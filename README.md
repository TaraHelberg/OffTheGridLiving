# Off The Grid Living  

![amiresponsive](./assets/readmeimage/amiresponsive.png)

Off The Grid Living is a landing site for those who are seeking to move from main stream living to off grid living. In this website you are introduced to the Earthship Eco home an innovative idea that addresses the 6 basic human needs and incorporates them right into the home environment. Making a Self-Sustainable Eco home that is both off the grid and modern.

Users of this website will be able to find information on the 6 basic human needs that are incorporated into the Earthship design along with links to further information a lovely gallery and video tur and a contact form should the user require further assistance or information.


# UX 

I wanted to aim for a visually appealing website that also imparted information to the user on the Earthship Eco Home as an Off The Grid Living option.
Keeping the site clean and sleek whilst engaging the user with the website whilst adding a touch of fun.
On the home page I went for an animated introduction picture on the home that zooms in in order to draw the eye to the home's look and feel. Under this I added 3 images that link to the other 3 pages of the site making it fun and visually appealing to keep the user engaged. Under these 3 images I added a short introduction in order to entice and add value to the information to follow.
The about page starts with a brief history acquired from Wikipedia and referenced within the history paragraph with a link to this site, also here I have added at the end of the history paragraph for more information 2 external links to the original Earthship website and again to Wikipedia. The about page information is set up in a row column format with information to one side and an image to another so the user can choose to glance at the images or read the information either way the information is visible and understandable the hope is the images entice the user to read the information.
The Gallery and tour section is set up with an iframe YouTube video tour about the Earthship eco home and is only playable if the user decides to play it under this there are gallery images of the Earthship home both external and internal images to show the user what the home could and does look like.
The Contact Us page is set up very clearly and minimalistic so as to not distract from the main point of getting contact information making to clean and easy to use under this is a Google Earth map that shows the location of the original Earthship location should the user be inclined to find them as an additional pull to the user to make contact.
Adjustments have been made from the original wireframes made for the project this was to add value and a better flow to the webpages made.

    + Deployed project was tested in my default browser Microsoft Edge as wells as Google Chrome and Firefox.


# Bugs

Debugging occurred during the process of development and testing as the website was built as testing was done constantly as errors "bugs" were detected during testing I would use dev tools to see and test what would solve the particular error that occurred and or do searches in the Technologies and support mentioned above and fix the errors as they occurred.

# Validator Testing

* Test Validators
    + HTML - W3C Html Validator - No errors returned when pass through
    + CSS - W3C CSS Validator - No errors returned when pass through
    + RESPONSIVENESS - Am I Responsive for different divices media queries.
    + LIGHTHOUSE - Website tested for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practice and SEO as seen below.

# Deployment of Project

* Deployment was made possible by GitHub
    + Initiated a repository in git
    + Deployment via git repository to the GitHub page and linking the main root to this and thus been hosted by GitHub.

# Credits

   * Code Institute without who I would have had no base to begin a project
   * GitHub for my workspace and saving all my work as well as my deployed project
   * Reuben Ferrante my mentor without all his great guidance I would be lost and who also suggested the smooth-scroll for my internal links. A Huge Thanks.
   * The Slack community - for someone always been there no matter the time and with advice or direction.
   * Balsamiq used to build the wireframes for my project.
   * Earthship Biotecture for the inspiration and information for my project
   * Wikipedia Earthship section for information for my project
   * W3C Validators both HTML and CSS to keep a check on my code.
   * I am Responsive for a fantastic spot to see a visual of responsiveness.

* Copied Code / Code assistance  
As stated in Technologies / Support Used I used and sort out help and code from numerous sources as well as fonts and icons. However, I did exclusively copy code from Love running for the animation on the home page and gallery. Stack over flow played a huge roll in my overall development especially the card link images where code was copied for most of the elements used in these.
