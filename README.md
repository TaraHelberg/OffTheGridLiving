# UX 

I wanted to aim for a visualy appealing website that also imparted information to the user on the Earthship Eco Home as a Off The Grid Living option.
Keeping the site clean and sleek whilst engaging the user with the website whilst adding a touch of fun.
On the home page I went for a animated introduction picture on the home that zooms in in order to draw the eye to the home's look and feel. Under this I added 3 images that link to the other 3 pages of the site making it fun and visualy applealing to keep the user engaged.Under these 3 images I added a short introduction in order to entice and add value to the information to follow.
The about page starts witha breff history aquired from wikipedia and referened within the history pharagraph with a link to this site , also here I have added at the end of the history pharagraph for more information 2 external links to the origianl Earthship website and again to Wikipedia.The about page information is et up in a row column format with information to one side and an image to another so the user can choose to glance at the images or read the information either way the informaiton is visable and understandable the hope is the images entice the user to read the informaiton.
The Gallery and tour section is set up with a iframe youtube video tour abut the Earthship eco home and is only playbale if the user decides to play it under this there are gallery images of the Earthship home both external and internal images to show the user what the home could and does look like.
The Contact Us page is set up very clearly and minamilistic so as to not destract from the main point of getting contact information making to clean and easy to use under this is a Google Earth map that shows the location of the original Earthship location should the user be inclined to find them as an additional pull to the user to make contact.
