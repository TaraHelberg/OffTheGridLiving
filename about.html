                <h3>Shelter</h3>
                <p>Earthship shelters are a type of architecture designed around human needs taking advantage of natural
                    elements to both heat and cool the housing. Often made up of both natural and upcycled materials. A
                    common usage for the main wall structure been earth-packed tires of which on this planet there is an
                    abundance.</p>

                <h3>Water</h3>
                <p>Earthships waster harvesting system works on collecting all of its water from rain and snowmelt on the roof into a gutter system that feeds into a cistern. The cistern has pumps and a filter system that cleans and purifies that water from here it is distributed around the home for daily household use.</p>

                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>Earthship interior, organic food production uses the grey water from the home itself to sustain the plants along with this is a mini-hydroponic plant system allowing vertical growing space and in most Earthships a living wall that produces food plants as well and for those who wish to add to the environment of growing the addition of Aqua-botanical is a viable option. The ability to grow your own food and harvest it within the home environment itself.</p>

                <h3>Energy</h3>
                <p>Every Earthship home has its own independent power plant using both solar panels and wind turbines depending on your area you could if circumstances allowed even add hydro power however this is not a common element for power but an option. All the power generating systems are hooked up to batteries, charge controller and inverter. The home is designed with energy efficiency in mind this includes using modern technologies that allow for lower energy usage but also a comfortable lifestyle.</p>
