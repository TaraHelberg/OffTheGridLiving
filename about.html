            <h3>History</h3>
            <br />
            <p>Earthship architecture began development in the 1970s, when the architect Michael Reynolds set out to create a home that would fulfill three criteria. First, it would utilize sustainable architecture, and
                materials indigenous to the local area or recycled materials wherever possible. Second, it would rely on natural energy sources and be independent from the electrical grid. Third, it would be feasible for a person
                with no specialized construction skills to build. Eventually, Reynolds's vision was transformed into the common U-shaped earth-filled tire homes seen today.
                The name is based on the idea of a ship or a space ship, in order to allude to the home's ability to provide everything for their inhabitants to survive: shelter, power, waste management, water, and food. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthship" target="_blank">(Wikipedia)</a>

                <p>Earthship shelters are a type of architecture designed around human needs taking advantage of natural
                    elements to both heat and cool the housing. Often made up of both natural and upcycled materials. A
                    common usage for the main wall structure been earth-packed tires of which on this planet there is an
                    abundance.</p>

                <p>Earthships waster harvesting system works on collecting all of its water from rain and snowmelt on
                    the roof into a gutter system that feeds into a cistern. The cistern has pumps and a filter system
                    that cleans and purifies that water from here it is distributed around the home for daily household
                    use.</p>

                <p>Earthship interior, organic food production uses the grey water from the home itself to sustain the
                    plants along with this is a mini-hydroponic plant system allowing vertical growing space and in most
                    Earthships a living wall that produces food plants as well and for those who wish to add to the
                    environment of growing the addition of Aqua-botanical is a viable option. The ability to grow your
                    own food and harvest it within the home environment itself.</p>

                <p>Every Earthship home has its own independent power plant using both solar panels and wind turbines
                    depending on your area you could if circumstances allowed even add hydro power however this is not a
                    common element for power but an option. All the power generating systems are hooked up to batteries,
                    charge controller and inverter. The home is designed with energy efficiency in mind this includes
                    using modern technologies that allow for lower energy usage but also a comfortable lifestyle.</p>

                <p>At is core structure Earthships are designed to make the most of the natural heating and cooling via
                    solar and thermal heating and cooling reducing costs greatly. The large window section facing the
                    sun at a slanted angle which is the front of the home and the greenhouse section heats the home
                    whilst into the back of the home piping is set to the outside with vents enabling a natural flow of
                    heating and cooling.</p>

                <p>All water from the Earthship water harvesting is used four times within the Earthship home. The Gray
                    water flows into the botanical cells, the plants use up and treat water it is cleaned in this manner
                    until it is collected in a well and pumped on demand for such usage as toilet flushing. Toilet water
                    goes to a conventional septic tank, overflowing into an exterior rubber-lined botanical cell to
                    exterior landscaping plants. Thus, allowing Earthships to thrive without water from the ground or
                    municipal water.</p>
